You can download the source and run it on you own pc or use it direcyly online at

The rule-writer contains most common rules for variation sudoku. It was created to make the task of writing rules easier for myself. Because of that it mainly contains the rules I use most. I will probably extend this in the future and add more rules. Feel free to modify it and adapt it for your own use. 

Just add your rules to rules.js and they should appear. It should be pretty much self-explanatory.

The source-package contains all files you'll need and can be used directly in your browser. It has been tested with firefox and chromium. 

It looks like this:
